# pythonGame
This is a fun aracade game that was given to me as part of an interview. I had to improve upon a basic Python Game by adding colors, interesting shapes, sounds, and more. 

The following dependencies are required to run this program:

pip (python installer)

python3

pygame

pydub 

simpleaudio

It is compatible with Mac High Sierra
